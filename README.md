jhunt/hacks - A Homebrew Tap For Hackers
========================================

If you like to have nice things, this homebrew tap is for you.

    $ brew tap jhunt/hacks
    $ brew install vex cdoc errno

It's all the fun utilities I have written and maintain, available
for free, on your Mac!  What more could a hacker ask for?

Utilies Included
----------------

- **cdoc** - A documentation extractor for C codebases
- **vex** - A vim-like hex editor
- **errno** - A small utility for printing error numbers / strings
- **tt** - A non-nonsense time tracker, for {freelanc,consult}ing

Just `brew install X` for any of the above utilities and you
should be good to go.

Happy Hacking!
